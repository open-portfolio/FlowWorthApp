# FlowWorth App

_Portfolio valuation and tracking tool for the Do-It-Yourself Investor_

This application is part of the [OpenAlloc](https://github.com/openalloc) family of open source Swift software tools.

It is formerly a proprietary application now entirely open-sourced in August 2022. 

It has been written in _Swift_ language and the _SwiftUI_ framework using Xcode 13.4

The current target is macOS 12.0 (Monterey) and newer, for Intel and Apple Silicon. This requirement will move forward in the future.

Thereâ€™s strong potential for supporting iPadOS/iOS, but would require further development and testing by interested developers.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. You are encouraged to submit pull requests to fix bugs, improve documentation, or offer new features. 

The pull request need not be a production-ready feature or fix. It can be a draft of proposed changes, or simply a test to show that expected behavior is buggy. Discussion on the pull request can proceed from there.

Contributions should ultimately have adequate test coverage. See tests for current entities to see what coverage is expected.
